        Description
      </h2>

      <li>
       "I lost a keychain. It has a silver bead chain going through a hole on a flat side of a plectrum shaped plastic decoration. The decoration is white, with patterns that looks like mica sheets (that are used for crafts), on the middle of the decoration is a blue silhouette of a walking girl, she has short hair."

        Design Process
      </h2>

      <body>
        I began with mapping out shapes in Illustrator tho create the chain and base shape and its texture. For the more complex figure in the center, I used SVG-to-p5 to help me create the shape.

      <h2>
        Reflections
      </h2>
      <body>
        The descriptions for the lost object were detailed enough for me to infer what it had look like. However, that required a lot of background knowledge as a human and plugging in missing information, and simplifying shapes (for example: the exact shade of blue, the shape of a plectrum, mica sheets, etc.) which all had to be translated into numerical values for p5.
