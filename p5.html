        </h2>

       <body>
        To create the exquisite corpse, I formed my first figure using Illustrator and came up with a backstory for the character.
        </body>

        <img class= "main" src=corpse1.png height= "720px" width= "400px">

        <p>
        Backstory of my figure: While working as a royal greeter for the evil king and queen, he was granted a wish by a wizard. Because he was on his feet all day, he wished to never feel sore ever again. The wizard turned him into a teal-colored robot and he could never feel anything again.
        </p>

        <p>Backstory of the combined exquisite corpse with Chris and Simon: As a result of his good work Detective Jim was chosen to find an explanation for the haunted museum and weird events surrounding the humanoid glass window exhibition. Unfortunately, he was cursed to take on the form of a robot sculpture.</p>

        <body>
          The process of creating the corpse was made easier by using the concept of modularity. Creating functions for separate body parts helped me keep my code more organized, making it easier to work with. However, I had to pay closer attention to how I called each function to make sure my layering was correct.
